# `svd-parser`

> A CMSIS-SVD file parser

japaric/svd is currently undergoing a major refactor (see: [#46](https://github.com/japaric/svd/issues/46) and the [refactor](https://github.com/japaric/svd/tree/refactor) branch for progress), please beware that any new PRs against master will probably have to be reimplemented once this is merged.
